# Pyogotchi: Tamagotchi on Steroids
---
This project aims to create a Tamagotchi-like simulation game for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The game allows users to experience the joy of having a customizable virtual pet without the additional costs and commitments associated with real pets. By integrating various sensors, including photoresistors, an RFID reader, and a 2.4GHz radio, the game will feature engaging behaviors and interactions that enhance the user experience.


Included are MicroPython library implementations for:
- SSD1306
- AHT20
- DS3231
- NRF24L01 (TODO)
- RC522 (TODO)


Documentations for these libraries can be found [here](google.com).

## Current Progress
- [ ] Implemented MicroPython libraries for AHT20, DS3231, SSD1306, and RC522 modules (RC522 and NRF24L01+ modules not installed yet)
- [ ] Developed a custom graphics engine for the SSD1306, improving text capabilities and sprite handling
- [ ] Created a foundational game engine
- [ ] Established behavior flow for the virtual pet
- [ ] Designed and created sprites for the game

## Future Improvements
- Upgrade to a more powerful microcontroller (RPi Pico 2W 16MB when available)
- Integrate additional sensors, such as accelerometers and Wi-Fi capabilities
