Hi! I doubt anyone else is reading this, but this project is important to me personally and I will scream into the void if it means whatever I have to say will be said.

And also I am in need of a Pensieve, for time is a *cruel friend*.

It has been weeks since I last worked on this project. The first few days was because I achieved something that I had visioned for a while, so naturally a break was needed. I also had to move out of my current abode due to family issues. My grades weren't great, and my mental state was a roller coaster that just loves going downhill.

But, one of the two good boys and girls that I dedicated this whole project, including my time, money and sanity into, has passed. It has been such a pain to open the folder again, because I could have totally prevented it - one of them had been obnoxious and in a fit of anger my mom let it go to a butcher. I wasn't even supposed to know, and I feel horrible knowing that **a)** a person I have been fighting for, been sacrificing endlessly for the past few months had completely disregarded my discretion, and also unreasonably punished my informant. **b)** I have missed him so much, yet the least I could do is look forward to my annual visit back to see him again.

The pain of losing hope and betrayed, all in the span of a few months, is slowly making me lose my marbles.

But this is all the more reasons to bring this project to fruition, to where it'd be great where I can walk around, play with it, show people what I made, tell people how proud I was of that good boy and girl and the immense happiness and hope they give me, even when all they can do is shove their nose into my balls and I can only see them through a tiny screen halfway across the globe.

Soooooo yeah. This project will still go back and grow with better, more robust features. It's only a fun personal project, but it combines every hobbies that I have - embedded programming, circuit design, game design, pixel art, app development, web development, hacking, communications, etc. and I **cannot** wait to see the extent I can push this thing. But until then, I'll have to clear my mind first, and drop all of the memories that I can scrape off the bottom of the barrel to build something I'd be fond of for years to come.

I raised that lil shit to be no quitter. Then I have no reason to become one.
