# Project Details
This is going to be a massive ongoing project with plenty of expandability - animation, connectivity, IoT, you name it, I really want to bring it over to the device. MicroPython however, would be a roadblock, so this would be the knowledge database for anything I'd want to look up in the future.

# Basic Libraries

## Basics
IO: Machine

## Drawing
Currently using framebuf, but might phase this out in the future due to inflexibility in animation and text display.
