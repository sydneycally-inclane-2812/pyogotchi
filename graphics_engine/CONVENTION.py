# CONVENTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT:
# X is always left-right, Y is always up-down, blit also follow that convention
# blit accounts for the dimension of the sprite itself. Lemme check if it allows for negative positioning as well,
# otherwise need to create a function for that.
# IT DOES ALLOW NEGATIVE POSITIONS HOLY COW
